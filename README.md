CORS Adminer Bundle
--------

We love Adminer! And we had to bring it back. This bundle brings back Adminer into Pimcore 11.

Also shoutout to Blackbit (https://github.com/BlackbitDigitalCommerce) for the original implementation for Pimcore 11. We separeted this from the amazing DataDirector Bundle into a standalone bundle.

  ```bash
  composer require cors/adminer

  ```
3. Run the installer
